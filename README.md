Create M3U for all PSX Games (muti disk games and single disk games) in CHD Format
Based on https://www.reddit.com/r/RG351/comments/q726fa/hi_everyone_how_do_i_play_multidisc_games_that/
Have python installed, put all Games in the CHD format into the psx folder on your arkos folder and start the script. It will create m3u files for all your games and these should be used for starting the games (activate hide all non m3u files for psx in the advanced settings)
