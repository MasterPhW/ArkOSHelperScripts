Create M3U for Multi Disk PSX Games in CHD Format
Based on https://www.reddit.com/r/RG351/comments/q726fa/hi_everyone_how_do_i_play_multidisc_games_that/
Have python installed, put all Multi Disk Games in the CHD format into one folder on your arkos folder, that is not your PSX folder, e.g. psx-multidisk and start the script. It will create m3u files for all your games and these should be moved to your PSX rom folder
